        <h1>How Do Websites Work?</h1>
        <p>The internet works through a simple request and 
        responce process from <i>client</i> to <i>server</i>. 
        <h2>How do does this process work?</h2>
        First you need to get software: a browser. Then—
        through a ISP—your browser will connect to a DNS server
        via a HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol). The DNS server
        will then—through HTTP—respond by providing the IP address
        of the site you're looking to visit. The DNS is pretty
        analogous to a phonebook. From there your computer will
        be able to connect to the web server where the browser 
        can then request and recieve the web page.
        <h2>Computer information to visuals</h2>
        To display the webpage to the user, the computer
        needs instructions. To do that front-end developers
        the people who make webpages, use a markup language. 
        These markup languages use tags (markup) to provide
        structure and meaning to the webpages. Our internet overlords,
        W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), have graced us with many
        standards over the time of the web; the most recent
        standard is HTML5.  
        <b>HTML is not the only part of a website.</b>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the presentation and
        appearance of a site, while Javascript provides dynamics.
